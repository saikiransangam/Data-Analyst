# Investigate a Dataset

## No-Show-Medical-Appointment-Investigation
 
### Project Overview
The No-show appointments project is to analyze a dataset and then communicate the findings about it. The project consist of going through the entire data analysis process, starting by posing a question and finishing by sharing the findings.

### Project Data
Data Set: No-show appointments dataset collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil kaggle which could be found here and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment. Various characteristics about the patient are included such as Gender and Age as well as each individual's primary health designations such as Hypertension, Alcoholism, and Diabetes. Six months of appointment data are assessed below.

### Methodology

The general methodology followed to perform the investigation:

Data Wrangling : Moving raw data into dataframes for manipulation. 

Data Cleaning : Transforming data to uniform format.

Data Analysis : Exploring data and patterns.

Data Visualization : Visualizing and drawing conclusions.


#### Details
I have looked into the dataset and managed a few problems like unifying names, removing wrong data, adding new features based on existing data. I have also investigated most of independent variables in the dataset and made a few observations comparing them to each other as well as to the dependent one (no_show). As this was only an exploratory analysis, many potential correlations may remain uncovered. The data should be investigated further with more advanced statistical analysis to potentially reveal new insights and correlations.
